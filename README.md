ng Augment Native scroll [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ng-augment-native-scroll.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/ng-augment-native-scroll) [![Bower version](https://badge.fury.io/bo/ng-augment-native-scroll.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/bo/ng-augment-native-scroll)
========================
_This is a angular (v1.x) port of the original experiments with [augment native scroll](https://github.com/iamvijaydev/augment-native-scroll)_

This module aims to provides few directives to augment the native scroll:

* `connectScrolls` will connect scrolls within `scrollArea` so that they scroll synchronously. Meaning if one scrolls other will too. For non-touch devices it can also apply kinetic scroll. Here's an [example](https://iamvijaydev.github.io/ng-augment-native-scroll/examples/connectedScrolls.html).
* `kineticScroll` will apply touch-device-like smooth and kinetic scroll to native scroll. You can (mouse) click-hold to drag the scroll and release-flick to auto-scroll just like a kinetic scroll on touch devices. Here's an [example](https://iamvijaydev.github.io/ng-augment-native-scroll/examples/kineticScroll.html).

**NOTE: Kinetic scroll with mouse events will be applied to non-touch devices only. It will NOT be applied on touch devices.**


# Installation and usage
###Via yarn or npm:
```shell
# yarn (recommended)
$ yarn add ng-augment-native-scroll

#npm
$ npm install ng-augment-native-scroll --save
```
Then use it as:
```javascript
var angular = require('angular');
angular.module('mainApp', [
    require('ng-augment-native-scroll')
]);
```
###Via bower:
```
$ bower install ng-augment-native-scroll --save
```
Then use it as:
```javascript
var angular = require('angular');
var ngAugmentNativeScroll = require('./bower_components/ng-augment-native-scroll/src');

angular.module('mainApp', ['ng-augment-native-scroll']);
```
You can also include it in the old fashion way as:
```html
<script src="/bower_components/ng-augment-native-scroll/dist/ngAugmentNativeScroll.js"></script>
<!-- or -->
<script src="/bower_components/ng-augment-native-scroll/dist/ngAugmentNativeScroll.min.js"></script>
```

###Direct use:
Download the files as [zip](https://github.com/iamvijaydev/ng-augment-native-scroll/archive/v0.13.2.zip) or [tar.gz](https://github.com/iamvijaydev/ng-augment-native-scroll/archive/v0.13.2.tar.gz). Include it in your HTML file and use it in your script file as shown below:
```
// template.html
<script src="path/to/file" charset="utf-8"></script>

// main.js
angular.module('mainApp', ['ng-augment-native-scroll']);
```


# `connectScroll` and `scrollArea` directive usage
These directives can be used like the example below:
```html
<connect-scrolls options="options">
    <scroll-area>
        <ul id="list">
            <li ng-repeat="item in data.list">{{ item }}</li>
        </ul>
    </scroll-area>
    <scroll-area>
        <table id="table">
            <tbody>
                <tr ng-repeat="row in data.table track by $index">
                    <td ng-repeat="cell in row track by $index">{{ cell }}</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </scroll-area>
</connect-scrolls>
```
`scrollArea` requires `connectScroll` and `connectScroll` expects `scrollArea` to define the scrollable areas to be connected. Neither can be used alone. You can use multiple `connect-scrolls` within the same scope. You can even nest one within other. But **do not** overlap one another, it's not supported yet.


# `kineticScroll` directive usage
This directive can be used like the example below:
```html
<kinetic-scroll options="options">
    <table id="table">
        <tbody>
            <tr ng-repeat="row in data.table track by $index">
                <td ng-repeat="cell in row track by $index">{{ cell }}</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</kinetic-scroll>
```
`kineticScroll` expects its first child to be a scrollable area. It's better to wrap just the scrollable item with kineticScroll. You can use multiple `connect-scrolls` within the same scope. You can even nest one within other.


# Configurable options
Option | Description | Type | Default
--- | :--- | :--- | :---
`name` | Give it a name, a unique name. The directives will be exposing the helper methods to the $parent scope on this namespace. Provide a unique name when using multiple or nested instances. | String | NA
`enableKinetics` | **On touch devices kinetics won't be applied.** Apply touch-device-like smooth and kinetic scroll to native scroll. You can (mouse) click-hold to drag the scroll and release-flick to auto-scroll just like a kinetic scroll on touch devices. | Boolean | `true`
`movingAverage` | The [moving average filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average) protects the kinetic scroll going to a frenzy state. A lower value will have a slow and smooth kinetic scroll | Number | `0.1`
`preventDefaultException` | Mouse events for kinetic scrolling is prevented from executing default action, i:e`e.preventDefault()` is called internally. This can make elements non-responsive. For e.g: select wont open. You can provide `tagName`, `class` or `id` that when matched wont call `preventDefault`. By default input, textarea, button and select are exempted. | Object | [Look here](https://github.com/iamvijaydev/ng-augment-native-scroll/blob/master/src/augNsOptions.value.js#L6-L8)


# Exposed methods to $parent
Both directive `connectScrolls` and `kineticScroll` will expose couple of methods to it's parent scope. With the exposed methods we can control the scroll from $parent scope; for e.g. scroll to start or end. The exposed methods will be available on the namespace ~~`augNs`~~ as provided in in the options. For e.g. let's assume the option is `{ name: 'myAugNs' }` then the exposed methods will be available on `$scope.myAugNs`  Here are the list of exposed methods:

Name | Description
--- | :---
`scrollToStart` | Scrolls all scroll to start, i:e scrollLeft and scrollTop are set to `0`
`scrollToStartLeft` | Scrolls all scrollLeft to start
`scrollToStartTop` | Scrolls all scrollTop to start
`scrollToEnd` | Scrolls all scroll to end or max scroll, i:e scrollLeft and scrollTop are set to possible max scroll value
`scrollToEndLeft` | Scrolls all scrollLeft to end or max scroll left value
`scrollToEndTop` | Scrolls all scrollTop to end or max scroll top value
`scrollToPosition` | Scrolls to the positions provided as arguments. `$scope.augNs.scrollToPosition({Number} left, {Number} top)`
`scrollByValue` | Scroll to new positions by adding the arguments provided to current positions. `$scope.augNs.scrollByValue({Number} left, {Number} top)`

Here is an example of how it can be used on the $parent scope:
```javascript
// connect-scroll options
$scope.options = {
    name: 'myAugNs'
}

// reset scroll after fetching new data
DataService.fetchUserList()
    .then(function (data) {
        $scope.userList = data;
        $scope.myAugNs.scrollToStart();
    })
```
